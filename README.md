### Description:
- This project leverages an Open API to enable automated extraction of information and answering of questions from PDF documents. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) capabilities provided by the Open API, the system parses through PDF files, identifies key text passages, and generates precise responses to user queries. By integrating with the Open API, the project aims to streamline document management processes and enhance efficiency in information retrieval tasks.
